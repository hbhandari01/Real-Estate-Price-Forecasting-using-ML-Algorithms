# House-Price-Prediction
This project predicts 🏡 House Prices using Machine Learning models. We preprocess housing data, perform EDA, apply different regression models, and finally predict house prices.

📌 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing (missing values, outliers, scaling, log transformation)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Building: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation using R², MAE, MSE

Final Prediction: ₹ 4,69,770 (Random Forest Regressor, log-transformed back to original scale)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Results

Best Model: Random Forest Regressor

Predicted House Price: ₹ 4,69,770

✅ Future Improvements

Use XGBoost / Gradient Boosting
